# LAMMPS-LBM-PSM-2025

This repository hosts an optimized Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) coupling for fluid-particle simulations, refactored from Tim Najuch's original LAMMPS-LBM-PSM package (https://github.com/timnajuch/LAMMPS-LBM-PSM). Assisted by DeepSeek's AI capabilities, we've optmized the codebase to enhance performance, improve clarity, and strengthen maintainability while preserving the core physics and functionality.

## Key Improvements
- **Performance**: Optimized critical algorithms and memory handling
- **Clarity**: Restructured code with modern C++ practices and documentation
- **Maintainability**: Modularized components and improved error handling
- **Correctness**: Verified against original reference cases
